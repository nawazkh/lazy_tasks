# Rebase repo current branch

This folder aims to provide a script you can run at the root of all the git repos. This script would then attempt to rebase all the repos with their `main` or `master` branch.

**Note**: This script is intended to use with _forked-cloned_ repos instead of _cloned_ repos.

## Customizations

- In Makefile
  - update the `#VARIABLES` section for your local testing
